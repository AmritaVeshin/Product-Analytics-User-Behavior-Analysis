## Overview

Welcome to the User Behavior Analysis Project repository! This project aims to analyze and gain insights from user behavior data using Python and Google Colab. Understanding how users interact with a product or service is crucial for optimizing user experiences and making data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement

In today's digital age, businesses and organizations collect vast amounts of user data. The challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights from this data to enhance user experiences, increase conversions, and drive business growth. This project addresses the following key objectives:

- **Data Generation:** Generate synthetic user behavior data using Python and the Faker library.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze user behavior patterns, conversion funnels, and cohort behavior.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Derive actionable insights to improve user experiences and optimize conversions.
- **Educational Resource:** Serve as a learning resource for data analysts and data scientists to practice user behavior analysis techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **User_Behavior_Analysis:** Python code file (.ipynb) for the generation of synthetic user behaviour data along with User Behavior Analysis EDA 
- **synthetic_user_data:**  Generated user behaviour data file (.csv)
- **README.md file:** This README file 

## Usage

To get started with this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `notebooks/` directory for Jupyter notebooks containing code and analysis.
3. Use the synthetic user behavior dataset provided or generate your own using the provided code.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to perform user behavior analysis.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries and tools:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Faker
- Jupyter Notebook (for running notebooks)

Install these dependencies using `pip` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib Faker jupyter
```
